# Unnamed C64-Game Reproduction #

I needed a learning project where I wasn't working alongside a tutorial and also could forego graphical and sound design (mostly). I decided on reproducing the mechanics of an old c64 game ([Atari's Mario Bros](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Mario_Bros_(Atari)) for the C64) purely by observing its gameplay and mechanics.

I do not intent to release this to the public (via itch etc) and probably won't add much graphic or sound fidelity to speak of.

### Goals
* Emulate the gamefeel as close as possible while maintaining good coding practices 
* Avoid using too many built-in Unity features (e.g. physics)
* Find best practices in using Unity's new input system, especiall with regards to players joining mid-game, mixed input methods and local multiplier
